In this paper, we proposed SQLiteKV that is a SQLite-like key-value database engine. SQLiteKV adopts the LSM-tree-based data structure but retains the SQLite operation interfaces. It consists of two parts, a front end that contains a light-weight SQLite-to-key-value compiler and a cache, and a back end that contains a LSM-tree-based key-value database engine. 
We have implemented and deployed our SQLiteKV on a Google Nexus 6P Android platform. The experimental results with various workloads show that SQLiteKV can significantly outperform SQLite.
